## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Get used to use Flex and Grid layouts, and knowing when to choose one over another depending on the achievment and responsiveness.
I learned to play a bit with the **rem** units.

### Continued development

This is my first coding challenge ever! I'm not new to HTML, CSS and JS. But I'm self-taught, and the time has come to make it my job.
I still need to learn about the newest functionalities (grid e.g.).
